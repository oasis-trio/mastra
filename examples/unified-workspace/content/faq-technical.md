## API Rate Limits

API Rate Limits by Plan:

- Free: 100 requests/minute, 1,000 requests/day
- Pro: 1,000 requests/minute, 50,000 requests/day
- Team: 5,000 requests/minute, 500,000 requests/day
- Enterprise: Custom limits

When you hit a rate limit, you'll receive a 429 error. Implement exponential backoff in your code to handle this gracefully.
